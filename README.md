# ReactNativeTaskTrackerApp
//The Task
Build a simple React Native app that lets users keep track of tasks. The user should be
able to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and view a list of all tasks. When a task is
added or completed, the app should collect the user's current location (latitude and
longitude) and store it with the task.

//The functional Requirements of the App are;
The app has a form that allows the user to add a new task.
● The app displays a list of all tasks, with each task showing its name,
completion status, and location.
● The user of the app can mark a task as completed.
● The app stores the task list in state.
● The app uses the Geolocation API to collect the user's current location
when a task is added or completed.
